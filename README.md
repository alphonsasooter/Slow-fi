### Project Description
Slow-Fi Simulator is a quirky and interactive web project that mimics a Wi-Fi system where your internet speed depends on how much you're moving ‚Äî or at least, how much you say you're moving.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People move too much while using Wi-Fi, and that‚Äôs clearly unacceptable. Fast movement deserves slow internet ‚Äî for balance and peace of mind. Slow-Fi solves this fake problem by punishing motion with painful buffering.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a web interface that pretends your movement affects Wi-Fi speed. It uses a slider to represent movement. The faster you ‚Äúmove,‚Äù the slower your simulated internet gets. At high speeds, you even get fake buffering messages to shame your impatience.

## Technical Details

# Installation
[commands]:
1. Create a simple HTML page with a title, slider, and dynamic text placeholders.


2. Add a JavaScript function to monitor slider input and adjust the displayed internet speed.


3. Use conditions in JavaScript to simulate buffering when the movement is high.


4. Style the page using CSS and animations (@keyframes) for blinking text.
